<div>
<p>A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up and down his body just for fun. This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse desperately requested the lion to set him free. “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.” The lion laughed at the mouse’s confidence and let him go.</p>

<p>One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the lion with them. They tied him up against a tree. The lion was struggling to get out and started to whimper. Soon, the mouse walked past and noticed the lion in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the ropes to set the lion free. Both of them sped off into the jungle.</p>

 <div>
<p>One day, king Akbar asked a question in his court that left everyone in the courtroom puzzled. As they all tried to figure out the answer, Birbal walked in and asked what the matter was. They repeated the question to him.</p>

<p>The question was, “How many crows are there in the city?”</p>

<p>Birbal immediately smiled and went up to Akbar. He announced the answer; he said there were twenty-one thousand, five hundred and twenty-three crows in the city. When asked how he knew the answer, Birbal replied, “Ask your men to count the number of crows. If there are more, then the relatives of the crows must be visiting them from nearby cities. If there are fewer, then the crows from our city must be visiting their relatives who live outside the city.” Pleased with the answer, Akbar presented Birbal with a ruby and pearl chain.</p>

 <h3>Moral of the Story:</h3>
<h4> Having an explanation for your answer is just as important as having an answer.</h4>

<div>
<p>There was once a woodcutter, working hard in the forest, getting wood to sell for some food. As he was cutting a tree, his axe accidentally fell into the river. The river was deep and was flowing really fast – he lost his axe and could not find it again. He sat at the bank of the river and wept.</p>

<p>While he wept, the God of the river arose and asked him what happened. The woodcutter told him the story. The God of the river offered to help him by looking for his axe. He disappeared into the river and retrieved a golden axe, but the woodcutter said it was not his. He disappeared again and came back with a silver axe, but the woodcutter said that was not his either. The God disappeared into the water again and came back with an iron axe – the woodcutter smiled and said it was his. The God was impressed with the woodcutter’s honesty and gifted him both the golden and silver axes.</p>

<div>
 <p>On a hot summer day, a fox wandered across the jungle in order to get some food. 
He was very hungry and desperately in search of food.
He searched everywhere, but couldn’t find anything that he could eat.
His stomach was rumbling and his search continued.
Soon he reached a vineyard which was laden with juicy grapes.
The fox looked around to check if he was safe from the hunters.
No one was around, so he decided to steal some grapes.
He jumped high and high, but he couldn’t reach the grapes.
The grapes were too high but he refused to give up.
The fox jumped high in the air to catch the grapes in his mouth, but he missed.
 He tried once more but missed again. He tried a few more times, but couldn’t reach.
It was getting dark and the fox was getting angry. His legs hurt, so he gave up in the end. 
Walking away, he said, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”</p>

<div>
<p>A boy named Raj was upset because he had done poorly in his English test. He was sitting in his room when his grandmother came and comforted him. His grandmother sat beside him and gave him a pencil. Raj looked at his grandma puzzled, and said he didn’t deserve a pencil after his performance in the test.</p>

<p>His grandma explained, “You can learn many things from this pencil because it is just like you. It experiences a painful sharpening, just the way you have experienced the pain of not doing well on your test. However, it will help you be a better student. Just as all the good that comes from the pencil is from within itself, you will also find the strength to overcome this hurdle. And finally, just as this pencil will make its mark on any surface, you too shall leave your mark on anything you choose to.” Raj was immediately consoled and promised himself that he would do better.</p>
